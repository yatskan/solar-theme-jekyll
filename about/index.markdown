**pricing hacker** is a place for me to share my knowledge of and experience in pricing strategy and growth marketing. I welcome comments and requests to cover specific areas as well as sharing your own blog posts on these subjects.     

I am also a restless polymath and have taken an interest in a variety of unrelated areas. You could find some of my thoughts in the *Random* section.
